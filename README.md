Important Notes
Legal Compliance: Web scraping may violate a website's terms of service. Please ensure you are compliant with Indeed's terms before using this tool for any commercial or large-scale scraping.

IP Blocking: If you are scraping frequently or at a high rate, you might encounter IP blocking. To avoid this, consider introducing delays between requests or using proxies.

Dynamic Content: Some content on Indeed may be dynamically loaded. This scraper does not handle JavaScript rendering and only scrapes the static HTML content. For JavaScript-heavy websites, tools like Selenium may be required.

Potential Improvements
Error Handling: Add more robust error handling to manage unexpected situations such as network errors, data extraction failures, or page structure changes.
Proxy and User-Agent Rotation: Implement proxy and user-agent rotation to avoid IP blocking by the website.
Headless Browser: For dynamic content, use a headless browser like Selenium to scrape JavaScript-rendered data.
Additional Data Fields: Expand the scraper to extract more job-related information, such as company size, job benefits, or application instructions.
